# Building Yourself

So you got a nice job out of college, you're being a rockstar in your first few years. Now what? For many of us this will be your first career - and that's a lot to handle in itself. How do you approach something that you will probably be doing for as long as you've been on this planet?

This section is will go over some personal improvements and learnings that I've come to realize are important or even more important than the career-specific ones that I've laid out in previous sections.

Big disclaimer again that these are very personal to me and my values, and you will probably develop your own sense of value. Hopefully these can help you along your journey.
