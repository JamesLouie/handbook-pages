# The Handbook

The Handbook is a collection of resources and references made to help guide new software engineers through their career.

## Who am I

I've worked in a variety of different contexts like software engineer and consultant with every kind of technology including: mobile development, web development, monolithic systems, and distributed systems. My expertise has been development optimization in making teams more effective.

## How to use this Website

This website is collection of topics that I think would be helpful in the journey of budding software engineers. There are parent sections that organize topics into different phases of one's career. Feel free to jump to different sections that apply to you.
