# The Handbook

The Handbook is a collection of resources and references made to help guide new software engineers through their career.

## Introduction

My name is James Louie and I've been a software developer for 6 years and some change. I've worked in a variety of different contexts like software engineer and consultant with every kind of technology including: mobile development, web development, monolithic systems, and distributed systems. My expertise has been development optimization in making teams more effective.

I decided to make this minisite because I want to help the next generation of software engineers become successful in their careers. Over the years I've onboarded many times and helped many through the process - and I always find it lacking. My theory is that the better the onboarding experience, the faster you will be able to be effective to the team. It's just that no one really prioritizes that because once they finish onboarding they just want to move on and don't look back.

I want to provide insight into how you can be more effective before starting, when you start, and throughout your career.
