# Resume Builders

My thoughts on how to create an effective resume. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but things that I think are important. There's a ton more to go over so I suggest it reviewed by your peers, counselors, or heck you can send it over to me if you'd like.

1. Create a well-structured resume using a grid system. A grid system is composed on "tables" that allow you to present your information in a more clear manner. This will allow you to make justifications and content changes much easier without affecting the whole document.
2. Be sure to list of all the technologies (Java, Python, Go, etc), tools (Git, Vscode, IntelliJ, AWS, etc), processes (Agile/Scrum, Git Flow, etc) that you are familiar with, as that is what recruiters are looking for.
3. The standard length for your resume should be a page. And you should try to value all the space on that page because that is all you have to communicate to the recruiters. That doesn't mean to smash as much text on to the page as possible, but you should use the space and include powerful arguments why you are a good candidate.
