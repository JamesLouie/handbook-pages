# College Preparation

The name of the game is preparation, and the ones that best prepare will have the most opportunities come the time. In the case of software development, this means that those that are able to prepare will have more offers on the table, and be able to choose from a variety of opportunities to start your career.

## Preface

This is not a guide to get you into any specific company, but for general knowledge from reflecting on my college decisions and how they have helped me.

If you want to get into specific companies like F.A.N.G, you should read the holy grail, [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakman McDowell.
