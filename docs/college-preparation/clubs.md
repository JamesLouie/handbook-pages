# Clubs

Joining a computer science club was the most transformative experience for me, and I stand behind it being the most important part of my college experience.

## Industry Exposure

Much of what I new about the software industry is because of the clubs I was affiliatd with. We were the ones that put on tech demos, company meet and greets, hackathons...you name it. There was plenty of opportunities that you are put in where you are talking with real industry experts.

## Organization Leadership

I wasn't chess club president in high school, so college clubs was my first experience at working a group of people on something that had a real impact. You will learn how about planning, logistics, and leadership. You'll be tasked with a lot of hard decisions, some of which will be great successes and some will be epic failures. This was an important learning lesson for me, because I made some HUGE mistakes during my time that has shaped how I approach leadership in my career now. You learn a lot about yourself and how your beliefs work with real people, and I think thats invaluable experience.

## Social Life

Clubs are just fun! I was able to find some of my best college friends during my time at these clubs. From learning more about the industry to chugging beers at the Pub - there was a lot of great memories. One of the great things about building geniune relationships is that everyone will go there ways and you may find yourself with a lot of options as you move throughout your career. I've made personal recommendations to my companies which got people hired, as well as each of my jobs has come from a friend I made in college.
