# Books

This is a section about books in the workplace.

## The Pragmatic Programmer

The most transformative book I have read that lays the groundwork for being an effective programmer. Read my section on [pragmatism](https://thehandbook.jamlouie.com/excelling-in-the-workplace/pragmatism.html).

## Clean Code

Second most influencial book I have read for developers. Gives you a framework for writing maintainable, readable code that will apply to every language or technology you will use in the field.

## Drive

This was a book I had to read during management training, and what it taught me is the basis of motivation. It argues that the carrot-and-stick approach only breeds temporary motivation and stifles true motivation in the long run. What we need to focus on is the intrinsic (here it is again!) goals such as meaningfulness and flow to drive greater satisfaction instead of extrinsic goals such as reward and punishment. This is helpful in understanding a lot of workplace dynamics and how to motivate yourself and your team to success.
