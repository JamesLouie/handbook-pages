# Books

This is a section about books in the workplace.

## The Pragmatic Programmer

The most transformative book I have read that lays the groundwork for being an effective programmer. Read my section on [pragmatism](https://thehandbook.jamlouie.com/excelling-in-the-workplace/pragmatism.html).

## Clean Code

Second most influencial book I have read for developers. Gives you a framework for writing maintainable, readable code that will apply to every language or technology you will use in the field.

## Managing Up by Mary Abbajay

Read the section about managing up, this goes into more depth than I covered in my section.
